# Project Progress Log

**Purpose:** this file is the running state of the project across working sessions. Read it
first at the start of any new session, before anything else, to know exactly what already
exists. Update it last, at the end of every phase, after the phase's code actually works.

**Rules for updating this file:**
- Append a new entry per phase. Never edit or delete a previous phase's entry, even if
  something built in that phase is changed later. Add a note in the *current* phase's
  entry instead ("Phase 3's `/api/verify` timeout was raised here because...").
- Be concrete: file paths, not vague descriptions. Write "Added `decodeQr()` in
  `src/lib/extract/qr.js` with a 3x-upscale fallback", not "improved QR".
- "Known issues / TODOs" is not optional, even if a phase felt complete. Note anything
  deferred, simplified or assumed, however small. This is what stops small gaps from
  silently compounding across phases.
- Record measured numbers when a phase produces them: timings, counts, accuracy on
  samples. Never record a number you didn't actually measure.
- Record pinned dependency versions when they're added or changed.
- Errors and challenges go in `docs/challenges-log.md` (entries `C-001`, `C-002`, …),
  logged as they happen, not here. This file is state; that file is history.

## Planning — Documents and decisions

**Status:** complete

**Decisions made (by the user):**
- Project name: **VeriCert** (new repo `VeriCert`).
- Restarted from scratch with a phased plan. The earlier Netlify + Firebase build is
  superseded; lessons carried over are in CLAUDE.md, "Known facts".
- Hosting: Vercel. Database: MongoDB Atlas (M0, Mumbai). Language: JavaScript only.
- Access: verified `@pict.edu` accounts only, via Google or email/password.
- Output columns: Candidate Name, Course Name, Assignment Marks (/25), Exam Marks (/75),
  Verification, Tampering, Remarks.

**Files created:**
```
CLAUDE.md
docs/implementation_plan.md
docs/progress.md
```
`DESIGN.md` and `samples/` were provided by the user.

**Known issues / TODOs:**
| # | Item | Priority | Blocking |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Only 2 sample certificates (1 PDF, 1 JPG). Collect 5–10 more from different sessions and courses before Phase 4's heuristics are finalised | High | Phase 4 |
| 2 | Whether NPTEL accepts requests from Vercel's servers is unproven | High | Phase 3 gate |
| 3 | Resend needs a verified sending domain for real users; without one, only the test domain works | Medium | Phase 10 |
| 4 | A custom domain (e.g. `verify.pict.edu`) needs PICT IT | Low | Phase 10 |
